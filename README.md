# N_Queens

### Exercise
#### This assignment I learned in course CodeClinic on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/code-clinic-c-plus-plus-2/solution-overview-eight-queens?autoplay=true&contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A56d799343dd559b764b88a89&u=95224177)
***On a chess board. You need to place N queens so that they don't eat each other (4 =< N <= 8 )***

### Intalation and test 
1. Clone the repo 
2. You need any C++ Compile 
3. Build using the build command pertaining to the said compiler. Eg. clang: "clang++ -std=c++17 *.cpp -o main && ./main"
>Run the command:
>./main 8
> or ./main 8 all :to show all of solution on your case (you can choose  4 =< N <= 8)

### What we learn
1. Recursion, backtracking
2. Use memcpy:
You can see how to use memcpy this link : ***[MEMCPY](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/memcpy-in-c-cplusplus#:~:text=memcpy()%20function%20is%20an,binary%20copy%20of%20the%20data.)***
